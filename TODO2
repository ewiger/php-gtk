Generator
~~~~~~~~~
* Pointers
* Write handlers for properties
* Make property-based constructors use pre-code generated by arg types
* gunichar arg type
* Fix Boxed_Arg to require explicit CE in php_gtk_parse_args().

Base Functionality
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Some classes need to be coded in C entirely, see gtk-types.c
* Interfaces
* Atoms
* Implement __gtype, __doc, and other special properties, if possible
* Deal with clone() handler in Zend
* Maybe use zend_call_function() instead of call_user_function_ex() to take
  advantage of function call cache
* Construction of arbitrary GObjects() via argument lists
* Integration with pkg-config
* Fix GdkEventType property handlers to cope with GdkAtom, GdkRegion, GdkNativeWindow and GdkDragContext

Classes and Functions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* GdkGC
	implement property access (read/write)
* GtkListStore
* GtkTreeModel
* GtkTreeStore
	Some iterator functions as get_iter() are expecting a GBoxed parameter.
* GtkTreeView
* GtkCellRenderer
* GtkClipboard
* GtkEntries can't be var_dumped, probably something missing
* GtkTreeModelFilter constructor doesn't take a model / does it have a constructor?? didn't see one in gtk.defs
* Would it be good to call GtkLabel::set_ellipsize(PANGO::ELLIPSIZE_END) as part
  of an override for (left-justifying) GtkLabel::set_width_chars() (optional param)?
* GtkTextBuffer->create_tag() is not implemented
* GtkTextBuffer->move_mark_by_name('selection_bound', ...) moves both the the
  insert and select_bound marks
* GtkTextTagTable->lookup() is not implemented
* GtkTextTagTable->foreach() is not implemented
* GtkTextTag does not do anything. Either the properties must be accessible or
  a method must be defined to set them (i.e. GtkTextBuffer->create_tag()).

Fix
~~~
* StyleHelper does not implement handlers that ZE2 _requires_ right now. Need
  to change either ZE2 or StyleHelper.


Thoughts on reference counting and wrappers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. We should probably not ref the GtkWindow/GtkInvisible after construction.
   It leaves a hanging reference around and the window will not get destroyed by
   Gtk+. The proper way to destroy the toplevel window is via
   gtk_window/widget_destroy(). Calling gtk::main_quit() is not enough.

2. Since we lack a garbage collector, we need to fake it. We need to override
   del_ref handler on the object, which will make sure that our wrapper is
   destroyed only if the referent gobject also has refcount of 1, which we means
   that only we own it. Otherwise, we need to keep our wrapper from being
   destroyed and save a pointer to the wrapper in the gobject with notification
   turned on, so that when gobject is destroyed by Gtk+ our wrapper is destroyed
   as well.
