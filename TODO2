~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* Support signals and closures
* Make errors messages display Class::Method() instead of just method name
* Custom boxed types
* Some classes need to be coded in C entirely, see gtk-types.c
* Interfaces
* Pointers
* Implement __gtype, __doc, and other special properties, if possible
