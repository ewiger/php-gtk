GtkSourceView is a text editing widget that extends the standard Gtk2.x text
widget. It has features syntax highlighting for a number of languages in
addition to those found in many standard source editors. Check the demos/
directory for sample script(s).

You must add the --enable-sourceview switch to your ./configure statement when
you build PHP-GTK 2 in order to enable the extension.

NOTE: This extension is currently supported only on the *nix platform.
