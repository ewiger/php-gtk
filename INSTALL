Basic Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHP-GTK 2 uses configure to ease installation. The majority of people
will be able to install PHP-GTK by running:

./buildconf
./configure
make
make install

after extracting the source tarball and cd'ing to that directory.
Please note that you need root privileges to execute the last step.
The steps given above should work if you have PHP and Gtk+ installed
in their standard directories. If your installation is non-standard,
please read on.



Specifying `phpize'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard location for the `phpize' file is /usr/bin/phpize and
`buildconf' will look for it in the environment variable $PHPIZE and then
the PATH. If `buildconf' fails to find it, you may specify its
location:

./buildconf --with-phpize=/path/to/phpize



Specifying the location of PHP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PHP-GTK 2 requires PHP CLI versions 5.1.1 upwards. Many systems have dual
installations for versions 4 and 5. If the configure script is unable
to find the correct version of PHP, and you receive errors like:

configure: error: PHP CLI version is required,  found <>
(or)
configure: error: Could not locate PHP 5.1.1 or higher version executable.

then you may specify the location of the corresponding php-config:

./configure --with-php-config=/path/to/php-config



Other `configure' options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`configure' offers a wide variety of options to customize your
installation. You may type:

./configure --help

for a list of options and their short description. Options that are of
special interest are the --enable-* options. These will build PHP-GTK
2 with support for libraries that offer added functionality or
new widgets, as extensions.

The libglade extension is enabled by default, while the others have to
enabled manually. As an example, if you wish to build PHP-GTK 2
without support for libglade but wish to use the GtkSourceView
extension, your configure statement will be:

./configure --disable-libglade --enable-sourceview

Please note that most extensions require some external library to be
present for successful installation, and that all extensions are not
available on all platforms. Details of the libraries required and
platforms supported are present in the README files of the corresponding
extension in the ext/ directory.
