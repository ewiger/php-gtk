* Figure out what's up with getting/setting gc background/foreground colors and
  how to get RGB values from pixels.
* Provide access to GTK version number.
* See what other object definitions might have been missed by h2def.py.
* See if it's possible or needed to set GtkAdjustment properties (and similar
  ones).
* Add missing field defs to gtk.defs.
* Document limitation of not being able to assign color components directly in
  cascaded overloads, i.e. $style->base[GTK_STATE_NORMAL]->red = 55555.

* Have a separate _init() function for each module(). Also have .ini setting
  that automatically inits modules. Or make loadable modules.

* Test GdkRGB functionality.
* Implement GdkPoint support.

* gdk-pixbuf support
* Gnome support
* GtkHtml support
