* Investigate how to improve h2def.py or modify gdk.defs to define boxed type
  objects (GdkColormap, etc.)
* Figure out what's up with getting/setting gc background/foreground colors and
  how to get RGB values from pixels.
* Provide access to GTK version number.
* Fix $dialog->vbox->show() crash.
* See what other object definitions might have been missed by h2def.py.
* See if it's possible or needed to set GtkAdjustment properties (and similar
  ones).
* Add missing field defs to gtk.defs.
* Return by-ref parameters from functions (multiple values or not)
* Make pixmap support solid.

In PHP
