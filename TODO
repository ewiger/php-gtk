* Investigate how to improve h2def.py or modify gdk.defs to define boxed type
  objects (GdkColormap, etc.)
* Figure out what's up with getting/setting gc background/foreground colors and
  how to get RGB values from pixels.
* Provide access to GTK version number.
* Fix $dialog->vbox->show() crash [not fixable unless major Zend OO is done]
* See what other object definitions might have been missed by h2def.py.
* See if it's possible or needed to set GtkAdjustment properties (and similar
  ones).
* Add missing field defs to gtk.defs.
* Work on GtkMenu::popup().
* Document limitation of not being able to assign color components directly in
  cascaded overloads, i.e. $style->base[GTK_STATE_NORMAL]->red = 55555.
* Think about how to minimize creation of resources for something like
  count($clist->row_list).

In PHP
------
* Modify var_dump() and print_r() to check get property handlers when
  dumping information.
