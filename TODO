* Investigate how to improve h2def.py or modify gdk.defs to define boxed type
  objects (GdkColormap, etc.)
* Figure out what's up with getting/setting gc background/foreground colors and
  how to get RGB values from pixels.
* Provide access to GTK version number.
* Fix $dialog->vbox->show() crash.
* See what other object definitions might have been missed by h2def.py.
* See if it's possible or needed to set GtkAdjustment properties (and similar
  ones).
* Add missing field defs to gtk.defs.
* Move GtkBoxChild, GtkFixedChild, and GtkCListRow to php_gtk_types.c. Introduce
  generic le_wrapper instead of le_gtk_ctree_node and all - they are just
  structures and do not not need to be released. Write constructor and prop
  getter functions for them, use constructors in overrides.

In PHP
------
* Modify var_dump() and print_r() to check get property handlers when
  dumping information.
